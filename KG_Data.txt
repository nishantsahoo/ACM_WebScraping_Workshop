Learnt concepts of Continuous Integration, Shippable, Docker, NodeJS, AngularJS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.


Became super confident with Bash scripting and Unix command-line and fell in love with Git while it changed my life as a software developer.


Helped Shippable in migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, in redesigning their website UI, and in fixing bugs
